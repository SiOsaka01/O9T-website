                <h3>My Story by Si Osaka</h3>
                <p>One of the most serious challenges middle-aged men face, is struggling with their mental health
                    issues. With pressure, comes stress and without a suitable outlet, many men become depressed. In
                    some cases this can escalate. Having a community where men can talk openly about their issues, in a
                    safe environment and alongside others who are struggling with their lives; is what my experience at
                    Andy's Man Club is all about.<br>Many large towns and cities around the UK have a branch of Andy's
                    Man Club. Most guys who attend regularly agree it is a big help, with sharing their issues with
                    other guys facing their own storms.<br>From my experience of Andy's I have found that talking works
                    well, but additionally walking and talking keeps the feel-good factor alive. Just a few miles every
                    2 days helps us in many ways. Like our fitness, mental health, weight maintenance, circulation, diet
                    and sleeping; all these processes are positively influenced by walking.<br>I set up a Facebook Group
                    in summer of 2022, so friends and family of members of Andy's Man Club could post and read of their
                    adventures with walking. When people walk, make videos and take photos, this group site will store
                    their posts, stories and their shares.<br>This website is dedicated to all the people who have links
                    to Andy's Man Club and like to walk.<br><br>As a distance walker I set up the group with an extra
                    feature, walks that challenge a fit person who walks strenuous walks. I coined the phrase 'Epic
                    Walks'. Any walk over 15 miles qualifies for an epic walk. Though a true Admin-Level Epic Walk is
                    any walk covering a minimum of 50 miles in any 24 hour period. Not for the faint hearted.<br></p>
